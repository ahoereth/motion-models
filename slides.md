# Introduction
## multiple cameras...
**make motion detection straightforward**

## monocularity
makes things more difficult:

* noise
* occlusion

**we require prior information**

## prior models
sufficiently general to admit all possible motions  
<>  
strong enough to resolve ambiguities

## state of the art
activity specific models from motion capturing

**Problem:** Pose and motion data is extremely high dimensional, difficult to visualize and expensive to compute on.
